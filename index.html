    <p>In this paragraph I will be reviewing my favorite coffee from starbucks.
        I will always get the same coffe from starbucks, a shaken esperesso half the number of pumps 
        of pumpkin spice latte syrup(since it is in season now) and oatmilk. Very little will I deviate 
        from that as I am on the spectrum and love my routine and regular orders( I only ever order the same thing from mcdonalds when I go too and its been that way for years)
        when the baristas dont burn my espressos (which is a regular occurance) the flavors of the oatmilk,PSL,
        and espressos come together to create a most decidant expereience with coffee that only the highest of quality
        barista can create.
